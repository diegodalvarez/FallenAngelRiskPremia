And their cumulative returns. It's evident that the ANGL ETF picks up a considerable amount of extra return. Although its a bit speculative to assume, these returns streams are for the most part driven by rates but and their
credit risk premias, since there is a considerable amount of overlapping of securities and returns factors from the fallen angels ETF within the other we could surmise that there are returns (preferably alpha) that can be 
extracted.
